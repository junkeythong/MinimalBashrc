# MinimalBashrc
- I use Bash on Linux, need to rework it a bit for zshrc and on MacOS.
- The color is set based on my terminal light theme and needs to be reworked for personal terminal context.
- The kns() use to change K8S namespace, the ek() use to change K8s cluster, I use it a lot.

Demo from my terminal:
